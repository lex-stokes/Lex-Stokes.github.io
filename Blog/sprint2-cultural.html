          <h3>### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  </h3>
            <p>There once was a child called HTML who worked at an information desk and while they were good at giving information people often found 
            them very plain and boring and if they had to give a lot of information it could be hard to follow the flow. It became harder and harder 
            for them to give information as the workplace got bigger and more complicated, eventually they were at their wits end at people missing 
            crucial information because they overwhelmed them with stuff. So HTML went and had a chat to their supervisor and the supervisor noticed 
            how much busier they were and hired a helper for HTML. CSS was lovely but knew nothing about the business and it seemed to HTML they never 
            would, however the lovely and pretty nature of CSS drew people to them and they often had to ask HTML for the information so they could 
            pass it along to people in a way that was visually appealing for the client. CSS and HTML grew old together in their workplace relying on 
            each other to get their information across in a way people would appreciate and enjoy.
            </p>
            <h3>### Any moments of surprise or joy?</h3>
            <p>Writing that story! But I always have a moment of happiness when I center something, I really struggled with it to start with! 
            I also was very happy to already have a colour scheme in mind before anything else, it's the little things.</p>
            <h3>### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</h3>
            <p>I've been watching avatar the last air bender and i think that HTML would be a lion turtle and CSS a turtle duck! HTML because 
            the lion turtle is old and has watched many things change while its been around and people forget that it's a thing. And turtle 
            ducks are pretty and CSS is pretty so that's a very poorly though out statement but turtle ducks. But they both stem from the 
            same place and have a balance with each other. </p>
        <h3>My long term goal is to be happy!</h3>
        <p> I have found that my work as a barista was not engaging enough for my mind after many years (plus I like sitting down occasionally!) 
            and I am not able to pursue the event management career I was looking at doing. And it doesn’t seem like a viable option in the 
            immediate future so I am looking for things that engage my mind and allow me some creative freedom at the work place beyond the tip jars!</p>
            <p>I would like to become more confident in understanding and communicating my value to an environment. I always seek to learn more 
            information on feedback and mitigating unhealthy situations as I think these are extremely valuable skills. Creating an effective 
            communication statement and understanding what I am looking for and the words that I should use to gain what I want. Hopefully it 
            gets super technical at points but I’d also like to look at the broader use of communication statements.</p>
            <p>I hope to talk to people more about my professional work and learn to give and take feedback in an environment that pushes me to learn 
            constantly. Ideally this will mean you’ll see me all over the class discussions and forums talking and just fostering a better knowledge 
            base.</p>
            <img class="img" src="../img/kojo2.jpg">
            <p>I am very easily adaptable and quick to learn. I like understanding different approaches to the same problem and enjoy the problem solving 
            process more than the solution unless there is a time restraint. That’s when I tend to hyper focus on creating the best possible outcome 
            given the restraints of the situation. On the flipside I am easily distractible (my work so far has really driven that point home for me), 
            sometimes things take time to sink in and often overbook my time. Though I am hoping this course will, and so far it’s holding true, make 
            me more aware of my time and value it in a way that is productive to my growth as a person.</p>
            <p>Keeping and setting toggl goals that give me time for feedback and resolution before deadlines has been helping a lot, though I know I 
            still have room for improvement here so I’ll keep at it!</p>
            <p>In terms of free time I have to dedicate to this course, if I keep my time management skills to their goals, I sleep at night and they 
            tell me I need to eat three times a day so I guess I’m busy then because eating over a computer ALWAYS results in stray crumbs under a key. 
            It's just how I am.</p>
            <p>Well hopefully I’ll talk to you all soon and we can all learn from each other. :)</p>
