        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand and process the emotional energy within yourself and the surrounding environment.
             This is something that one can learn from the surrounding environment and people who influence it. 
            It is different to an IQ because it looks at a different part of how the brain understands and comprehends things. 
            IQ is calculated in comparison to the standards held by an overall look at humanities Intelligence quotient. But it’s practically
             impossible to grade ones EQ, each person has a different level of exposure to EQ that shapes how much they factor it into their 
             day to day lives and how they respond to the environment they are in. Communicating clearly and effectively is an extremely useful 
             tool that allows, in an ideal world, all parties to gain the resources they need or want. And having a “good” EQ will allow you to 
             understand the best ways to achieve your communication in a way that is beneficial to all. Those with a “good or great” EQ will be 
             good communicators who assess the need of those around them and factor that into any decisions that need to be made, often resulting 
             in all or most of the parties involved having a positive outcome.</p>
