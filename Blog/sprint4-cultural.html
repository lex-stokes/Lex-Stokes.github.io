    Understanding that the brain is a malleable tool allows people to shape their own perception of how they want their brain to function. 
    It gives them the understanding that they can create and train the skills they want to. If people understand that they can change the entire 
    way that their brain functions, and how, then they are more likely to apply the principles of neuroplasticity to their lives. They are going 
    to engage in activities that they may find harder or more taxing with the concept that the more they do it the easier it will become.

    If one regularly does a crossword for example one will get better at crosswords, even if those few you google the answers you’ll remember 
    it and slowly gain a better understanding of crosswords. Over time less and less googling will occur. I do this with puzzles as well and 
    often have memory games on my games list to try and improve in areas I feel lacking in.

    There are so many ways to increase your neuroplasticity. It’s very much about finding what works best for you and when, perhaps something 
    you are doing now isn’t clicking and you just need to stretch your brain in a different way! Go read some fiction, learn or practice an 
    instrument, or for a more tricky activity non dominant hand exercises but most importantly SLEEP!!!

    Growth mindset is the idea that one is capable of changing and growing. One with a growth mindset is more focussed on learning and sees 
    failure as an opportunity to learn. They aren’t confined to the idea of wanting to make sure they succeed in order to seem smart, which 
    allows for them to repeat tasks with the knowledge that they will improve. It’s a mindset best suited for learning almost any task, and 
    developing a skill.

    A lot of study results, many of the medical ones are relatively new when focussing on learning, especially regarding adults. But the 
    statistics are really overwhelming around the positive nature, and that the fixed mindset is more likely to cause people to lie about 
    their results.

    How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?

    I already have! I’ve set myself time goals and reminded myself to do a little bit every day. While not always achieving this I can definitely 
    see the days when I haven’t been coding. If I am struggling with something then I give myself some time to ponder, if I get frustrated then I 
    take a short break and come back to it. After that, if all my googling has been fruitless, I ask for help! I constantly remind myself that 
    while it’s over my head today if I look back to the first week some of that was over my head too and now I can do it, most of the time, pretty 
    well. And in the future it’ll be easier.
