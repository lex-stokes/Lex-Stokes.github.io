    <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>I get frustrated quicker than I thought, especially when I feel like I should know something! And as a result 
        I don’t ask for help as quickly as I should, the ego thinks it’s better than communication. You shall learn 
        ego, you shall learn… I also don’t notice when I’ve been at a computer for too long and my brain just isn’t 
        computing. The timer has made me really aware of this.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
    </h2>
    <p>Self awareness ensures that people are aware of the actions of others around them, this can stimulate growth 
        as it encourages you to talk to the people around you and see if you can gain knowledge or pass it on. 
        Empathy’s role is to allow us to work in an environment where everyone is taken care of in the way they need, 
        it stops us from directing rage or frustration at others and notice if the team has any issues and how we 
        should tackle them. And values have a role everywhere, they are the driving force behind why we make an action.
         A set of good values will help a team thrive together and create the best product that the team can make.
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>I wished there had been more about feedback as I think it’s a very difficult topic that many people don’t 
        put a lot of thought into, but I didn’t realise how much I would appreciate the “don’t worry about panicking” 
        talks each week. They were so good for my mental health and I wish more educational facilities would provide 
        this.
    </p>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>Reflecting on myself! And writing it all in a form that makes sense. Then posting it for others to read. Ekk!!
    </p>
    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web 
        development bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>Because how we communicate within a workplace defines how we work, a system of good, clear communication with 
        the team that we are working with means that we will progress through work at a timely pace with all 
        involved knowing what their goals and time frames are. It creates a healthier workplace that encourages 
        team members to contribute and feel comfortable giving feedback.
    </p>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
        Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>Not at all, while one can learn coding at their own pace with a lot of self directed study, it is quite hard 
        to navigate the core skill set through google search and having links to videos and raising awareness of the 
        different things our brains do while we learn and interact means that we have a better understanding of what 
        we are going through as we learn a new skill set. This allows our brain to not stress so much as we put it 
        through its paces to try and learn. Giving us hope makes a difference.
    </p>
    <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?     
    </h2>
        <h3>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you 
            like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
        </h3>
            <p>I would love a job that has flexible hours and allows me creative freedom while encouraging me to grow 
                and become more skilled. I hope that EDA will give my self directed study a push into making my coding 
                skills into something usable, while still retaining the joy of creating something that does what I want 
                it too. When I leave EDA I would love to help some of my friends create their own websites and in an 
                ideal wold find some freelance work that allows me to have a good work/personal life balance. I would 
                also enjoy growing into a role that allows me to help others. I will be applying for corporate monday 
                to fridays after this to work on having a good balance of work and personal life, I also find a lot of 
                corporate jobs have channels for growth easily accessible.

    <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
    </h2>    
        <h3>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course 
            of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will 
            help/hinder you during Bootcamp?
        </h3>    
            <p>I think my biggest strength will be my ability to absorb and adapt while my biggest limitations shall be 
            my ..ohh! Squirrel!, I mean how distracted I become by things. I’m sure there was something else… I’m so 
            forgetful. They are almost the same, hopefully that means I know myself pretty well! I have realised how 
            easy it is to forget something and having a few days off really drove that point home. I think forgetting 
            things easily will be very hard to deal with if I know that I’ve already been told something and then my 
            anxiety may kick in and I won’t ask for help. It’s good to realise this before and I think I shall set a 
            time limit for problems before asking for help so that I can keep on top of what I am trying to achieve.
            </p>  
    <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
        <h3>While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider 
            here. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking 
            in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.
        </h3>
            <p>I hate speaking in front of groups! While I’ve put together and presented some speeches I don’t enjoy 
                standing in front of people, especially about topics I am not completely comfortable with. I hope my 
                anxiety doesn’t overwhelm me and I keep to time plans that I set to relieve stress, as well as just 
                keeping to time plans in general. I do have fears that I won’t be able to complete the tasks in time 
                but fear should never prevent one from trying so let’s see how it goes!
            </p>    
    <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
        <h3>At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your 
            strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
        For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, 
        giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self awareness and 
        reflective skills.
        </h3>
            <p>I always feel one has room to grow, I am currently looking at finding a peaceful mentality while 
                still trying to challenge myself. I would like to grow my voice in a professional capacity as I 
                often find that I don’t speak up and therefore don’t contribute as much as I could. I love giving 
                and receiving feedback, and look forward to learning more about how I do and can improve on it. 
                I would like to focus on feeling comfortable talking about the work I am doing and communicating 
                it clearly. Lots of I statements here, which makes sense however. Looking at and understanding 
                why I am getting distracted is a good focal point that will lead to creating a better workflow 
                and more self aware work style. There should also be many new perspectives that should be gained 
                from working and being taught by people I have never met.
            </p>
    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
    </h2>
        <h3>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
        Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - 
        an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
        facilitators and industry/community representatives.
        </h3>
            <p>I try not to have expectations of myself. Or have goals that are too high, I shall get everything 
                that is taught and make it work? Seems terrible, I shall stick to time frames and ask if I have 
                been stuck on something for more than 15 minutes(I’ll probably adjust this time across the camp 
                once I have some idea of what’s going on in bootcamp) and it’s most likely I’ll ask the person 
                I’m working with, then the co-ordinator or my friend who does this for a job and is helping me 
                through the process. I’m not sure about the safely part? I won’t hurt other learners' feelings 
                because that’s not the type of person I am but I also won’t set their computer on fire or attack 
                them with it because of very obvious reasons. Also I’m anti violence so it would again be I’m not 
                that type of person. This stands for facilitators and industry/community representatives as well, 
                for the same reasons as stated above. I will probably ask via voice or perhaps a social messaging 
                platform for any help needed. After google, but I’ve probably done that in those 15 minutes. I 
                guess I expect I’ll get along with most of the people in the course and hope they find me polite 
                and courteous to their time and needs. Ideally I would be able to help others in their learning as 
                well. I have all the time in the world outside of course so I shall use that as catch time if I am 
                not able to help others but need the help myself.
