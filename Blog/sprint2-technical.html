<h1 class="hOne">What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
<p>  You've heard of a border right? It's that line, picture or series of dots around your writing!
</p>
<p id="example1">Just like this!</p>
<p>It's pretty simple from there, a margin is all the space outside a border and a padding is the space inside.</p>
<img src="../img/PBM.png">
<p> Well this feels a bit basic right? That's cause it is!</p>
<p>But how is this useful?</p>
<p>It allows you to play with space around things to create an impact.</p>
<div>
<span id="example2">Take this for example no padding or margin on my boring border.</span>
<span id="example3">If I stick it next to this box you'll see both boxes have very little space between the words 
    and the edge of the box and each other</span>
</div>
<p>And here's where we get to play around and have some fun</p>
<p id="example4">So here we create more space using both the padding and margin. Can you see how the change could be used?</p>
<span id="example5">And in a different way</span><br><br><br>
<p>All the code for these examples was short and easy and the numbers for padding and margin can be played around with super simply, I reccomend
    trying it. It's fun to see how much of a difference just changing one number can be!
