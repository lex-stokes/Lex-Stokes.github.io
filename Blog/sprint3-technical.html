  Oh hello friend, a conversation on what I’m learning this week? Basically… HTML is the cake and CSS is the icing and the plate. 
  HTML is perfectly fine on it’s own but CSS makes it fancy and look good plus a bit easier to digest! And that eating process we 
  have to do every day, that’s expressed in loops. Sometimes it’s cake but other times we don’t want cake and therefore have breakfast.
</p>
<p>
This order is more important in coding, sometimes if we have our cake before breakfast we just don’t work. And then we have a headache 
and something that doesn’t work. So to fix this we’d head over to our browser, from there we can check out all the coding I’ve been doing 
this week (just hit ctrl + shft + i) and bam! You’ve just started using what I’m apparently going to become really familiar with. I can 
fix all my coding issues from there!

Anyway back to the cake, we should go get food soon I think, but sometimes you want to take your cakes to other people's houses, and 
when you do that all of a sudden you have the impossible task of finding the right containers! Perhaps you’ve made cupcakes and you 
want them stored in an orderly fashion, or you’ve made an iced cake and can’t have another cake on top of it. This isn’t the best 
analogy but I’m going to force it. Perhaps the cupcakes have names on them but they are going to two different parties. The cupcakes 
need to be in the right place so they can be found when they are needed. For some reason one party preferred to be renamed with numbers. 
That party has a lot of reading if you’d like if you'd like to know many, many more theories but most of them seem quite logical.
</p>
<p>
And that almost sums is up for the week! But if we wanted to have those cupcakes ready to go, you’d get all those ingredients and make 
those cupcakes! In javascript we use functions to make stuff happen. The computer reads it and we get closer to the cupcakes doing 
whatever the cupcakes are going to do. The steps we use to make a cake are like the steps of a function. Put the eggs in, click a 
button, place in oven, set the timer and eventually, if all the steps come together in the right order you get whatever you set out to make.
</p>
<p>
And that’s enough of that, I’m going to go get some cupcakes. See ya!
