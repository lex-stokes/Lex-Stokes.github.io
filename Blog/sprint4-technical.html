  <h3>
    Got blocked on a simple problem
  </h3>
  <p>
    When I was looking at my for loop it looked fine to me but it was missing its little let at the start of the parameters! ohh, and there goes 5 mins!
  </p>  
  <h3>
    Solved a problem in an elegant way.
  </h3>
  <p>
    I wrote the code and it worked, I’m not sure if any of this work could be considered elegant. I stumbled across forEach and feel it could create 
    some elegant work in the future but as of yet I leave you with a cup of soggy disappointed leaves instead of tea.
  </p>
  <h2>
    In both cases:
  </h2>
  <h3>
    What was the problem?
  </h3>
  <p>
    It’s always either my spelling or not using the right syntax and therefore not getting the result I want
  </p>
  <h3>
    What problem solving techniques did you use?
  </h3>
  <p>
    As a thought, why doesn’t this thing have a spell check? But mostly I console log a lot until I find the source of my problem and then google 
    my issues from there. 
  </p>
  <h3>
    How did you feel throughout the process?
  </h3>
  <p>
    A little underwhelmed until I got to the stretch stuff, I felt like I should have given it more time but overall was happy with my learning 
    in the areas I needed too.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What did you learn?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Indexing! Is sometimes reaalllly different to dot notation but they both have a really useful place. I would like to look into .map and 
    forEach a bit more as they were things I got to earlier and then wandered away lost on a different tangent.
  </p>
  <h1>
    Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
  </h1>
  <h3>
    Pseudocode
  </h3>
  <p>
    Not confident at all! Next question!
  </p>
  <h3>
    Trying something
  </h3>
  <p>
    That's what got me here today. I'll do this first and often delete my previous work. Now to remember to just comment it out!
  </p>
  <h3>
    Rubber ducky method
  </h3>
  <p>   
    It may not be a rubber duckie but I am an expert at talking to inanimate objects around myself and pretending they are helpful! I may
    need to adopt a inanimate object for this exact purpose.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Reading error messages
  </h3>
  <p>
    I am fabulous at reading the error part, past there it's a bit hit and miss. I keep seeing undefined varibles though, so at least I can read that?
  </p>
  <h3>
    Console.logging
  </h3>
  <p>
    ALL DAY EVERY DAY. It's practically the most typed thing on my coputer at this point. 
  </p>
  <h3>
    Googling
  </h3>
  <p>
    I do this for way longer than I should sometimes but usally used with console.logging so that the console.logging means something to me.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Asking your peers for help
  </h3>
  <p>
    Could stand to get way better at this, tend to ask google first
  </p>
  <h3>
    Asking coaches for help
  </h3>
  <p>
    See above statement
  </p>
  <h3>
    Improving your process with reflection
  </h3>
  <p>
    I love reflecting. If I am struggling I like to remind myself that I couldn't do any of this 2 months ago! And then see what mess I was typing 
    back then. It's always a noticable difference so it generally makes me feel better.
